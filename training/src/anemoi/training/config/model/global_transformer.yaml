# Bounding configuration
bounding: #These are applied in order

  # Bound tp (total precipitation) with a Relu bounding layer
  # ensuring a range of [0, infinity) to avoid negative precipitation values.
  - _target_: anemoi.models.layers.bounding.ReluBounding #[0, infinity)
    variables:
    - tp

  # [OPTIONAL] Bound cp (convective precipitation) as a fraction of tp.
  # This guarantees that cp is physically consistent with tp by restricting cp
  # to a fraction of tp [0 to 1]. Uncomment the lines below to apply.
  # NOTE: If this bounding strategy is used, the normalization of cp must be
  # changed to "std" normalization, and the "cp" statistics should be remapped
  # to those of tp to ensure consistency.

  # - _target_: anemoi.models.layers.bounding.FractionBounding # fraction of tp
  #   variables:
  #   - cp
  #   min_val: 0
  #   max_val: 1
  #   total_var: tp

  # [OPTIONAL] NormalizedReluBounding
  # This is an extension of the Relu bounding in case the thrshold to be used
  # is not 0. For example, in case of the sea surface temperature we don't use
  # [0, infinity), buth rather [-2C, infinity). We do not want the water
  # temperature to be below the freezing temperature.
